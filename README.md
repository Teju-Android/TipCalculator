TipCalculator
=============

Calculates the Tip for any given Amount. The App design is made to look like a really old App and some weird colors are used. The concept of tiles is used so that it is easy for person to click on the tiles. 

The features that are implemented are:

<ol>
<li> Enter the amount and tip is displayed at the bottom tile with the selected TIP Tile</li>
<li> The tip is calculated as the amount is entered with the selected TIP tile </li>
<li> When there is no amount, there is a small message and there is no Tip Amount</li>
<li> The TIP percent can be changed by choosing the tile, and Tip amount is changed instantenously</li>
<li> There is a tile without any Tip percent, it means you need to enter the amount and thus Tip is calculated instantenously</li>
<li> When there is no tip, there is no Tip amount displayed</li>
<li> Drawables, Listeners are used get the functionality</li>
<li> ActionBar is hidden </li>
</ol>
